# COVID19 X-RAY IMAGE ANALYSIS
Developed a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images.
Collected and preprocessed a diverse dataset of COVID-19 chest X-ray images to train the model.
Conducted extensive performance evaluation and analysis, achieving an accuracy rate of 0.93 in classifying COVID-19 cases.
TechStack: Data collection and preprocessing, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, Python programming (TensorFlow, Keras), model evaluation, performance analysis.
